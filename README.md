# Video Silence Removal

This Python script removes silence from videos by extracting non-silent sections and creating a modified video with proper audio.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install moviepy pydub joblib tqdm

python
Copy code

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `video_silence_removal.py` script.

2. Import the required libraries:
```python
import moviepy.editor as mp
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.silence import detect_nonsilent
from joblib import Parallel, delayed
from tqdm import tqdm
Customize the example usage section in the script:
python
Copy code
video_path = "/path/to/input/video.mp4"
output_path = "/path/to/output/modified_video.mp4"
decibel_threshold = -50
min_section_duration = 600  # milliseconds
margin_duration = 200  # milliseconds
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python video_silence_removal.py
The script will remove the silence from the input video, create a modified video with proper audio, and save it to the specified output path.

Customization

Adjust the decibel_threshold variable to set the threshold for silence detection. Lower values indicate quieter sounds will be considered as silence.
Modify the min_section_duration variable to specify the minimum duration (in milliseconds) for a non-silent section to be included in the output.
Change the margin_duration variable to add extra time (in milliseconds) before and after each non-silent section for smoother transitions.
