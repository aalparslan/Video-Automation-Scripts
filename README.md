This Python script removes silence from videos by extracting non-silent sections and creating a modified video with proper audio.

## Requirements

pip install moviepy pydub joblib tqdm

python
Copy code

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `video_silence_removal.py` script.

2. Import the required libraries

##Customization

Adjust the decibel_threshold variable to set the threshold for silence detection. Lower values indicate quieter sounds will be considered as silence.
Modify the min_section_duration variable to specify the minimum duration (in milliseconds) for a non-silent section to be included in the output.
Change the margin_duration variable to add extra time (in milliseconds) before and after each non-silent section for smoother transitions.
